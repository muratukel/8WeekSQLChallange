**Introduction**

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Case Study Questions
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
* How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
* What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
* What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
* Which item was the most popular for each customer?
* Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
* Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
* What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
* If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
* In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT S.CUSTOMER_ID,
	SUM(PRICE) AS TOTAL_SPENT
FROM SALES AS S
LEFT JOIN MENU AS M ON M.PRODUCT_ID = S.PRODUCT_ID
GROUP BY 1;
````
###Output:
"customer_id"	"total_spent"
"B"	74
"C"	36
"A"	76
***
**2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID,
	COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_DATE) AS VISIT_COUNT
FROM SALES
GROUP BY 1;
````
**3.What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.CUSTOMER_ID,
	M.PRODUCT_NAME,
	S.ORDER_DATE
FROM SALES AS S
LEFT JOIN MENU AS M ON M.PRODUCT_ID = S.PRODUCT_ID
WHERE S.ORDER_DATE =
		(SELECT MIN(ORDER_DATE)
			FROM SALES)
ORDER BY S.ORDER_DATE;
````

**4.What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
  
SELECT M.PRODUCT_NAME,
	COUNT(S.*) AS TOTAL_ORDER
FROM SALES AS S
LEFT JOIN MENU AS M ON M.PRODUCT_ID = S.PRODUCT_ID
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY TOTAL_ORDER DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

**5.Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql

with customer_product_sales as 
(
	select 
		s.customer_id,
		m.product_name,
		count(s.product_id) as popular_order,
			rank() over (partition by s.customer_id order by count(s.product_id) desc ) as rank 
	from sales as s
 left join menu as m on m.product_id=s.product_id
group by 1,2
)	
select 
	customer_id,
   	product_name,
		popular_order
	from customer_product_sales 
 where rank=1;
