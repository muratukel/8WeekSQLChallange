**Introduction**

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Dannyâ€™s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Case Study Questions
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement:

* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
* How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
* What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
* What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
* Which item was the most popular for each customer?
* Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
* Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
* What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
* If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
* In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
