## ðŸ“ˆ Index Analysis

The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.

## 1.What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

## 5.Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?

When examining the provided output, it becomes apparent that the monthly highest average composition values exhibit variations across different months. These variations can stem from a range of underlying causes.

One possible driver for these changes is seasonal fluctuations. Demands within interest areas might experience a surge during holiday periods or special events, contributing to the observed differences.

Market trends and shifts in consumer preferences could also play a significant role. New products or services gaining popularity can influence the composition values positively, while older interest areas might experience a decline.

Increased competition or the implementation of competitive marketing strategies can lead to oscillations in the popularity of specific interest areas.

Furthermore, the evolving needs and changing preferences of the target audience can result in fluctuations in the monthly composition values.

It's important to note that anomalies could arise due to factors like incorrect data collection or calculation, adding another layer of complexity to the analysis.

The combination of these factors, interacting in various ways, contributes to the observed variations in the monthly highest average composition values.

While these fluctuations might not necessarily necessitate a complete overhaul of your business model, understanding the underlying reasons is paramount. It offers a deeper comprehension of your business and market dynamics, helping you maintain your competitive edge and make informed decisions.
