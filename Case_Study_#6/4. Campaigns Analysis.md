## Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

````sql
select 
	distinct u.user_id,
	e.visit_id,
	min(e.event_time) as visit_start_time,
	sum(case 
	   		when ei.event_name='Page View' then 1 else 0 end ) as page_views,
	sum(case

	string_agg(case

## 3.What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?

## 4.What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?
	
-- Click-Through Rate (CTR): Refers to the percentage of users who clicked on campaign ads after receiving an impression. A high CTR can indicate how attractive the campaign is to its target audience. For example, for the "Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)" campaign, CTR can help us determine how interested users are in the campaign.

-- Conversion Rate: Refers to how many users who clicked on the campaign's ads actually made a purchase. This metric shows how the campaign influenced the users who clicked through. A high conversion rate for a campaign with a low CTR may indicate that the target audience is genuinely interested in the campaign content.

-- Purchase Rate: Indicates how many users who received an impression or clicked through actually made a purchase. This metric shows the overall impact of the campaign. For example, the number of purchases made as a result of campaign impressions or clicks could be a metric for evaluating the performance of the "Half Off - Treat Your Shellf(ish)" campaign.

-- Uplift in Purchase Rate: Calculates the impact of the campaign on impression and click-through purchase rates by comparing the purchase rates of impression and click-through users. This metric can help us understand more clearly how the campaign is impacting its target audience.

-- Revenue Per User: Refers to the average revenue generated per user. It can be used to understand how much campaigns contribute to total revenue. A higher average revenue indicates that the campaign was successful.

-- These metrics are important tools for evaluating and comparing the success of campaigns. However, it is important to remember that each campaign has different goals and target audiences. The evaluation of success should be aligned with these metrics as well as the specific goals and business strategies of the campaigns.
