# Case Study #5: Data Mart

# ✔️ 1. Data Cleansing Steps

## 1.What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

````sql
select 
	distinct week_number
from clean_weekly_sales 
	where week_date = '2020-06-15'
````
## 2020-06-15 week = 25
## 4 before weeks 21 to 24 
## 4 after week 25 to 28 

| week_number |
|-------------|
| 25          |

## with case when solution

````sql
with week_sales as 
(
	select 
		week_date,
		week_number,
		sum(sales) as total_sales
	from clean_weekly_sales 
		where (week_number between 21 and 28 ) and (calendar_year = '2020')
	group by 1,2
), before_after_changes as 
(
	select 
		sum(case
		   		when week_number between 21 and 24 then total_sales end) as before_sales,
		sum(case
		   		when week_number between 25 and 28 then total_sales end) as after_sales
	from week_sales 
)
select 
	after_sales - before_sales as diff_week_sales,
	round((after_sales - before_sales)*1.0/before_sales*1.0*100,2) as growth_percentage
from before_after_changes
````
| diff_week_sales | growth_percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| -26884188       | -1.15             |


  ## with window functions solution 

````sql
with week_sales as 
(
	select 
		week_date,
		week_number,
		sum(sales) as total_sales
	from clean_weekly_sales 
		where (week_number between 21 and 28 ) and (calendar_year = '2020')
	group by 1,2
), lag_lead_sales as 
(
	select 
		week_date,
		week_number,
		total_sales,
		lag(total_sales, 4) over (order by week_number) as before_sales,
		lead(total_sales, 4) over (order by week_number) as after_sales
	from week_sales 
)
,total_lag_lead as 
( select 
		sum(before_sales) as before_changes_sales,
 		sum(after_sales) as after_changes_sales
 	from lag_lead_sales 
	)
select 	
	after_changes_sales - before_changes_sales as diff_week_sales,
	round((after_changes_sales - before_changes_sales)*1.0/before_changes_sales*1.0*100,2) as growth_percentage
from total_lag_lead;
````

| diff_week_sales | growth_percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| -26884188       | -1.15             |

## 2.What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

````sql
with week_sales as 
(
	select 
		week_date,
		week_number,
		sum(sales) as total_sales
	from clean_weekly_sales 
		where (week_number between 13 and 37 ) and (calendar_year = '2020')
	group by 1,2
), lag_lead_sales as 
(
	select 
		week_date,
		week_number,
		total_sales,
		lag(total_sales, 12) over (order by week_number) as before_sales,
		lead(total_sales, 12) over (order by week_number) as after_sales
	from week_sales 
)
,total_lag_lead as 
( select 
		sum(before_sales) as before_changes_sales,
 		sum(after_sales) as after_changes_sales
 	from lag_lead_sales 
	)
select 	
	after_changes_sales - before_changes_sales as diff_week_sales,
	round((after_changes_sales - before_changes_sales)*1.0/before_changes_sales*1.0*100,2) as growth_percentage
from total_lag_lead
````
| diff_week_sales | growth_percentage |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| -152325394      | -2.14             |

## It can also be done with case when as I did above.

## 3.How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?

## 4 week before-after 

````sql
with week_sales as 
(
	select 
		calendar_year,
		week_number,
		sum(sales) as total_sales
	from clean_weekly_sales 
		where week_number between 21 and 28 
	group by 1,2
), before_after_changes as 
(
	select 
	calendar_year,
		sum(case
		   		when week_number between 21 and 24 then total_sales end) as before_sales,
		sum(case
		   		when week_number between 25 and 28 then total_sales end) as after_sales
	from week_sales 
		group by 1
)
select 
	calendar_year,
	after_sales - before_sales as diff_week_sales,
	round((after_sales - before_sales)*1.0/before_sales*1.0*100,2) as growth_percentage
from before_after_changes
````
| calendar_year | diff_week_sales | growth_percentage |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2018          | 4102105         | 0.19              |
| 2019          | 2336594         | 0.10              |
| 2020          | -26884188       | -1.15             |

## 12 week before-after 

````sql
with week_sales as 
(
	select 
		calendar_year,
		week_number,
		sum(sales) as total_sales
	from clean_weekly_sales

	group by 1,2
), before_after_changes as 
(
	select 
	calendar_year,
		sum(case
		   		when week_number between 13 and 24 then total_sales end) as before_sales,

````
