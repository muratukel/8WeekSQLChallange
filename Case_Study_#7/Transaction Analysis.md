## 2.What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction
# According to the number of quantities

with in_each_transaction as 
(
	select 
	txn_id,
	sum(qty) as unique_qty
from sales 
group by 1
)
select 
	round(avg(unique_qty),2) as avg_unique_qty
 from in_each_transaction
````
| Average Unique Quantity |

	txn_id,
	sum(price*qty) as txn_revenue 
from sales 
group by 1 )
select 
	 PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY txn_revenue) AS q25_revenue,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY txn_revenue) AS q50_revenue,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY txn_revenue) AS q75_revenue
from txn_revenue_cte
````
| Q25 Revenue | Q50 Revenue | Q75 Revenue |

select 
	round(avg(value_discount),2) as avg_discount_value
from discount_transaction
````

## 5.What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
	 
# ROAD 1
````sql
with txn_transaction as 
(
select 
		member,
		count(distinct txn_id) as transactions 
from sales 
	group by 1
)
select 
	member,
	transactions,
	round((transactions*1.0/(select count(distinct txn_id) from sales)*1.0)*100,2) as ratio
from txn_transaction
````
| member | transactions | ratio  |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| false  | 995          | 39.80  |
| true   | 1505         | 60.20  |

# ROAD 2
````sql
select 
	round(sum(case 
			when member='t' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*),2) as member,
	round(sum(case 
			when member='f' then 1 else 0 end)*100.0/count(*),2) as non_member
from sales
````
| member    | non_member |
|-----------|------------|
| 60.03     | 39.97      |
