)
select

		unnest(string_to_array(extras,','))::numeric as extra
from customer_orders 
where extras is not null
order by extra desc
	)

select 	
		pt.topping_name,
		count(extra) as count_use_extra 
from extra as e 
left join pizza_toppings as pt on pt.topping_id = e.extra 
group by 1
order by count_use_extra desc;
```
