````sql
select count(pizza_id) as total_order_pizza

	from customer_orders;
````

**3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

````sql
select 
	runner_id , 
	count(order_id)
from runner_orders
where pickup_time is not null 
group by 1
order by 1;
````

**4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**

````sql
select 
	pn.pizza_name,
	count(co.order_id)
from pizza_names as pn
left join customer_orders as co on co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
where ro.cancellation is null
group by 1;
````

**5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

````sql
select 
	co.customer_id,
	pn.pizza_name,
	count(co.order_id) as pizza_count
from customer_orders as co 
left join pizza_names as pn on pn.pizza_id = co.pizza_id
group by 1,2
order by 1;
````
**6.What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**

````sql
select
	distinct co.order_id,
	co.customer_id,
	count(co.pizza_id) as max_pizza_count
from customer_orders as co 
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co. order_id
where ro.cancellation is null
group by 1,2
order by max_pizza desc
limit 1;
````

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

````sql
select * from runner_orders

select 
 co.customer_id,
count (case 
	when co.exclusions is not null or co.extras is not null then 1  end) as pizza_change,
	count (case 
	when co.exclusions is null and co.extras is null then 1  end) as no_pizza_change
from customer_orders as co
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
where ro.cancellation is null
group by 1
order by 1;
````

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

````sql
select 
	co.customer_id,
	co.order_id,
	count(co.pizza_id) pizza_count		
from customer_orders as co 
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
where ro.cancellation is null and co.exclusions is not null and co.extras is not null
group by 1,2;
````

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

````sql
select
	count(pizza_id),
	extract(hour from order_time) as hour_day_time
from customer_orders
	group by 2
	order by 2;
````

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

````sql
select

from customer_orders
