## üçù Solution - A. Pizza Metrics

**1. How many pizzas were ordered?**

````sql
select count(pizza_id) as total_order_pizza
	from customer_orders;
````
| total_order_pizza |
|------------------:|
|                14 |

**2. How many unique customer orders were made?**

````sql
select count(distinct order_id) as unique_customer_order
	from customer_orders;
````
| unique_customer_order |
|----------------------:|
|                    10 |

**3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

````sql

	runner_id , 
	count(order_id)
from runner_orders
where pickup_time is not null 
group by 1
order by 1;
````
| runner_id | count |
|-----------|-------|
|         1 |     4 |

|         3 |     1 |

**4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**

````sql
select 
	pn.pizza_name,
	count(co.order_id)
from pizza_names as pn
left join customer_orders as co on co.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
where ro.cancellation is null
group by 1;
````
| pizza_name   | count |
|--------------|-------|
| "Meatlovers" |     9 |
| "Vegetarian" |     3 |

**5.How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**

### 8. How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

````sql

from customer_orders as co 
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
where ro.cancellation is null and co.exclusions is not null and co.extras is not null
group by 1,2;
````
| customer_id | order_id | pizza_count |
|------------:|---------:|------------:|
|         104 |       10 |           1 |

### 9. What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

````sql

````
| count | hour_day_time |
