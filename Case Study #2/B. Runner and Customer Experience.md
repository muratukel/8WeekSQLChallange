# üçï Case Study #2 Pizza Runner

## Solution - B. Runner and Customer Experience

### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

````sql
select 
		count(runner_id) as runners_count,
		to_char(registration_date,'w') as week_period		
from runners  
group by 2
order by 2;
````
| runners_count | week_period |
|--------------:|------------:|
|             2 |           1 |
|             1 |           2 |
|             1 |           3 |

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

````sql

with diff_order_pick as 
(select 
    runner_id,
    avg(extract(epoch from (ro.pickup_time - co.order_time))) as avg_diff_order_pick
    from runner_orders as ro
left join customer_orders as co on co.order_id = ro.order_id
group by 1 
)

select 
    runner_id,
    extract(minute from timestamp 'epoch' + avg_diff_order_pick * interval '1 second') as avg_minutes_diff_order_pick
from diff_order_pick
order by 1;
````
| runner_id | avg_minutes_diff_order_pick |
|----------:|-----------------------------:|
|         1 |                           15 |
|         2 |                           23 |
|         3 |                           10 |

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
 with orders as 
  
  (
	  select 
  			count(co.pizza_id) as pizza_count,
			age(ro.pickup_time::timestamp,co.order_time::timestamp) as ready_time
  from customer_orders as co 
  left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id
  where ro.cancellation is null
  group by 2
  
  )
   
  select 
  		pizza_count,
		avg(ready_time) as avg_ready_time
from orders 
	group by 1
	order by 1;
````
| pizza_count | avg         |
|------------:|------------:|
|           1 | 00:12:21.4  |
|           2 | 00:18:22.5  |
|           3 | 00:29:17    |

### 4. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
select 
		co.customer_id,
		round(avg(ro.distance::numeric),2) as avg_travel_distance 
from customer_orders as co 
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id 
group by 1
order by 1;
````
| customer_id | avg_travel_distance |
|------------:|-------------------:|
|         101 |              20.00 |
|         102 |              16.73 |
|         103 |              23.40 |
|         104 |              10.00 |
|         105 |              25.00 |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

````sql
select 
		count(co.order_id) as total_orders,
		(max(ro.duration::numeric) - min(ro.duration::numeric ) )as longest_shortest_delivered		
from customer_orders as co
left join runner_orders as ro on ro.order_id = co.order_id 
where ro.cancellation is null;
````
| total_orders | longest_shortest_delivered |
|------------:|---------------------------:|
|          12 |                         30 |

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

````sql 
select			
		   distinct runner_id,order_id,
		   round(avg(distance::numeric / (duration::numeric/60)),2) as avg_speed		
from runner_orders 
		where cancellation is null	
group by 1,2			
order by 2;
````
| runner_id | order_id | avg_speed |
|----------:|---------:|----------:|
|         1 |        1 |     37.50 |
|         1 |        2 |     44.44 |
|         1 |        3 |     40.20 |
|         2 |        4 |     35.10 |
|         3 |        5 |     40.00 |
|         2 |        7 |     60.00 |
|         2 |        8 |     93.60 |
|         1 |       10 |     60.00 |

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

````sql 
with suc_delivered as 
(
	select 
		runner_id,
		count(order_id)::numeric as succes_order			 
  from runner_orders 
  where cancellation is null 
group by 1
 order by 1
) 
  , total_delivered as 
  
 (
	 select runner_id,
  count(order_id)::numeric as total_order
	 from runner_orders
	 group by 1
	 order by 1
 ) 
  select 
  		sd.runner_id,
		round((sd.succes_order / td.total_order)*100,2) as succes_ratio 
		
	from suc_delivered as sd 
	left join total_delivered as td on td.runner_id = sd.runner_id 
	order by 1
;
````
| runner_id | succes_ratio |
|----------:|-------------:|
|         1 |       100.00 |
|         2 |        75.00 |
|         3 |        50.00 |
