## :electron: D. Outside The Box Questions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

## 1.How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

## Let's calculate the growth rate based on the number of customers per month.

```sql
with month_customer as 
(select 
	date_trunc('month',start_date) as month ,
	plan_id,
	count(distinct customer_id) as customer_count
from subscriptions 
where start_date between '2020-01-01' and '2021-12-31' and plan_id not in (0,4)
group by 1,2)
select 
	m.month,
	m.plan_id,
	m.customer_count,
	lag(m.customer_count) over(partition by m.plan_id order by m.month) as previous_customers,
	round((m.customer_count-lag(m.customer_count) over(partition by m.plan_id 
       order by m.month)) / 
lag(m.customer_count) over(partition by m.plan_id order by m.month)*100,1) as growth_ratio
from month_customer as m
order by 1,2;
```
## Let me calculate the growth rate based on the sum of monthly plan fees.

```sql
with month_customer as 
(select 
	date_trunc('month',start_date) as month ,
	s.plan_id,
	sum( p.price) as sum_price
from subscriptions as s
 left join plans as p on p.plan_id=s.plan_id 
where start_date between '2020-01-01' and '2021-12-31' and s.plan_id not in (0,4)
group by 1,2)
select 
	m.month,
	m.plan_id,
	m.sum_price,
	lag(m.sum_price) over(partition by m.plan_id order by m.month) as previous_customers,
	round((m.sum_price-lag(m.sum_price) over(partition by m.plan_id 
       order by m.month)) / 
lag(m.sum_price) over(partition by m.plan_id order by m.month)*100,1) as growth_ratio
from month_customer as m
order by 1,2;
```
## Let's calculate the growth rate by years.

```sql
WITH customer_counts AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS current_customers, NULL AS previous_customers
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE start_date >= '2021-01-01'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT NULL AS current_customers, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS previous_customers
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
)
SELECT ((COUNT(DISTINCT current_customers) - COUNT(DISTINCT previous_customers)) / 
		COUNT(DISTINCT previous_customers)) * 100 AS rate_of_growth
FROM customer_counts;
```
