## ðŸ’¹ C. Data Allocation Challenge

## 1.running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction

````sql
select 
	customer_id,
	txn_date,
	txn_type,
	txn_amount,
	sum(case when txn_type='deposit' then txn_amount
	   		when txn_type='withdrawal' then -txn_amount
	   			when txn_type='purchase' then -txn_amount
	   
	   else 0 end) over(partition by customer_id order by txn_date) as running_balance
from customer_transactions
````

## 2.customer balance at the end of each month

````sql
select 
	customer_id,
	to_char("txn_date",'Month') as month,
	sum(case when txn_type='deposit' then txn_amount
	   		when txn_type='withdrawal' then -txn_amount
	   			when txn_type='purchase' then -txn_amount
	   
	   else 0 end) as closing_balance 	   	
from customer_transactions	
group by 1,2
order by 1
````

## 3.minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

````sql
with running_balance as 
(
select 
	customer_id,
	txn_date,
	txn_type,
	txn_amount,
	sum(case when txn_type='deposit' then txn_amount
